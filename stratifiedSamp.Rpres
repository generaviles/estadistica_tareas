What is Stratified Sampling?
========================================================

Population is partitioned in non-overlaping groups, called **strata** and a **sample** is collected from each stratum following a determined design.

Why use Stratified Sampling?
========================================================
<br \>
- May produce smaller error when estimating than simple random sample. Specially when measurements within strata have realitve small variation.
- Cost by observation reduced.
- There may be a need to have a subgroup (stratum) with similar estimates of those of the population.



Example
==========================================================
The Titanic Database:
```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(readr)
titanic <- read_csv("D:/Dropbox/MsC UABC/2o Semestre/Clases/Estadistica/tareas/titanictest.csv")
summary(titanic)
```

Variable Codes
=====================================================
<br \>
- `Pclass`: 1 = Upper, 2 = Middle, 3 = Lower.
- `SibSp`: Number of Siblings/Spouses aboard.
- `Parch`: Number of Parents/Children Aboard.
- `Embarked`: C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton.

Calculating Probabilities to select people who embarked in Queenstown
================================================================
<br \>
$P(A) = \frac{\text{Numero de elementos de A}}{n}$

There are 1310 entries, and 123 of them embarked in **Q**ueenstown, nevertheless the risk of dying was equally present for them as for the passengers from **S**outhampton or **C**herbourg.<br \>
If a uniform proability is calculated the numbers are:<br \>
- $P(Q) = \frac{123}{1310} =$ `r 123/1310`
- $P(C) = \frac{270}{1310} =$ `r 270/1310`
- $P(S)\frac{914}{1310} =$ `r 914/1310`

This approximation will hinder the process of data mining and, eventually, the generation of a machine learning model for survival prediction.

Fixing the Problem
==========================================================
By using **stratified sampling** we can raise the probability for the group that boarded in Queenstown and survived to be selected, therefore, taken in consideration for the generation of a survival prediction model. For this we will use **conditional probability**:

$P(Survived|EmbarkedQ)= \frac{P(Survived\cap EmbarkedQ)}{P(EmbarkedQ)} = \frac{44}{123}=$ `r 44/123`
```{r}
library(dplyr)
Q<-filter(titanic, embarked == "Q" & survived == 1)
count(Q)
```
